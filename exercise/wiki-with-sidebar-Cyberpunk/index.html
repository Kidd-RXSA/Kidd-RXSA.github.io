                <p>Cyberpunk is a subgenre of science fiction in a dystopian futuristic setting said to focus 
                    on a combination of "low-life and high tech". It features futuristic technological and scientific achievements, 
                    such as artificial intelligence and cyberware, juxtaposed with societal collapse, dystopia or decay.
                </p>
                <h3>Orgins</h3>
                <p>The term "cyberpunk" was coined by author Bruce Bethke in his 1983 short story of the same name. 
                    The genre gained prominence with the release of seminal works such as William Gibson's novel "Neuromancer" in 1984,
                    which established many of the genre's key themes and tropes.

                <p>Cyberpunk's roots can be traced to the New Wave science fiction movement of the 1960s and 1970s, 
                    which explored the impact of technology and the countercultural spirit of the times. 
                    Authors such as Philip K. Dick and J.G. Ballard influenced the tone and themes of what would later become cyberpunk.

                <img src="images/blade_runner.webp" alt="blade_runner" class="section-image">
                <p>The 1980s are often considered the golden age of cyberpunk. 
                    William Gibson, Bruce Sterling, and other authors helped define the genre with their focus

                <img src="images/Cyberpunk_Characteristics.jpg" alt="Cyberpunk_Characteristics"  class="section-image">
                <p>The defining characteristic of cyberpunk is the juxtaposition of high technology with a breakdown in social order.
                    The genre frequently features themes such as corporate control, hacker culture, artificial intelligence, and cybernetic augmentation.
                </p>
                <h3>Dystopian Settings</h3>
                <p>Cyberpunk stories are often set in dystopian futures with 
                    pervasive surveillance, megacorporations, and urban decay. 
                    The setting plays a crucial role in emphasizing the alienation and struggles faced by the protagonists.

                <p>Cyberpunk draws influence from earlier science fiction works, 
                    particularly those that focus on the relationship between humanity and technology. 
                    Authors such as Isaac Asimov and H.G. Wells laid the groundwork for cyberpunk's exploration 
                    of artificial intelligence and human-machine interaction.
                </p>
                <h3>Film and Media</h3>
                <p>Films like "Blade Runner" (1982) have had a profound impact on the visual and thematic elements
                    of cyberpunk. The aesthetic of neon lights, rain-soaked streets, and sprawling 
                    metropolises has become synonymous with the genre.
