                <h2>A Battle of Legends</h2>
                <p>Who would win in an epic battle between Ryu Hayabusa from <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> and Spawn from <em>Image Comics</em>? This thrilling clash pits skill against supernatural power, ninja discipline against hellspawn fury. Both are formidable fighters with extraordinary abilities, but they approach combat in very different ways. Let's break down what makes each of these characters a force to be reckoned with and see who might come out on top.</p>
